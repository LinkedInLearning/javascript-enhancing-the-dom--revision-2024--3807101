<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is at the core of every webpage. In order to develop dynamic HTML pages, a front-end developer needs to understand how JavaScript connects and lets you control the DOM in order to create, modify, delete and edit existing content on a page. In this course, designed for experienced web designers and developers, instructor Maaike van Putten provides an overview of basic DOM elements, the different ways JavaScript gives you access to the elements, and how to work with the DOM to create dynamic webpages.</p><p>Learn the fundamental skills required for selecting DOM elements, traversing the DOM, modifying DOM elements, and creating, adding, and managing nodes. Along the way, get tips on event handling, advanced DOM manipulation, accessibility, performance, and best practices. At the end of the course, youâ€™ll get the chance to test out your new skills on a real-world project by building an interactive resume app with a Node.js back end.</p>

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
