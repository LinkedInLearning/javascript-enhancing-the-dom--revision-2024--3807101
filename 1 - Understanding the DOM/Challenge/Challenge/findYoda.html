    <h1>Help Mia Find Yoda!</h1>
    <p>Look at this photo of Mia and her co-worker dog Yoda! Yoda recently ran away, your challenge is to find him!</p>
    <p>Rumor is, he’s hiding on a web page. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find him and reveal him
        so that Mia can take him back home.</p>
